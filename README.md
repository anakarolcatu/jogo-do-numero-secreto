# Project developed during the Oracle's One education course project.

**In this webpage, I generated a guess the number game where the user try to guess the mystery number between 1 and 10.** 

- The game will give hints if the number is lower or higher if the user gets it wrong.
- The user can play again after winning.
- It has a Responsive Voice text to read the text.
